# PROJECT
I started by creating a new repository on GitHub. This repository  hosted my Streamlit application's source code.
This was a Python file ( app.py) containing my Streamlit code.
Configured my Streamlit app for deployment:
Created a new file in the root of my repository named requirements.txt. This file lists all the Python packages and dependencies required by my Streamlit app. Streamlit  used this file to install the necessary dependencies during deployment.
Setting up Streamlit sharing:
Visited the Streamlit sharing website (https://streamlit.io/sharing) and signed in to my GitHub account.
Granted Streamlit access to the GitHub repository where my Streamlit app code is located.
Deployed my app:
On the Streamlit sharing website, I clicked the "New app" button and selected my GitHub repository from the list of available repositories.
Streamlit  initiated the deployment process, which involved cloning my GitHub repository and setting up a server to host the app.
